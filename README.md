## 💡 About the API

This application is a Recipe Sharing System built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) recipes.

## 🧩 Features

In the culinary world, sharing and discovering new recipes is an integral part of the experience. The Recipe Sharing API aims to facilitate this exchange by providing developers with a platform to build applications that enable users to share, discover, and explore recipes effortlessly.

1. **Recipe Management**:
- **Create:** Users can create their own recipes, including ingredients, preparation steps, and more.
- **Retrieve:** Users can access recipes  created by other users with detailed information such as title, description, ingredients, instructions, ratings.
- **Update:** Recipes can be edited and modified to reflect changes or improvements.
- **Delete:** Users have the ability to remove recipes from their collection.

2. **Search and Discovery**:
- **Name-Based Search:** Users may search for recipes by name. This feature enables users to easily locate a certain recipe if they know its name.
- **Name-Based Search:** Users may search for recipes by tag. This tool allows users to search for all recipes that fit into a given category, such as 'Lunch', 'Breakfast', etc.
- **ID-Based Search:** Users may search for recipes using their id.

4. **User Management**:
- **Login**: Allows users to log in with an existing account. If no such user exists, a new one will be created.
- **SignUp**: User is able to sign up with a unique username and password combination.

5. **Error Handling**: The application has comprehensive error handling. If an error occurs, the program will display a useful error message and, in development mode, a stack trace.


## 🎯Purpose
The Recipe Sharing API facilitates the sharing and discovery of culinary recipes among users, fostering community engagement and knowledge sharing within the cooking community. It provides a centralized platform for users to explore diverse recipes, interact socially, and organize their cooking experiences conveniently.


# ⚙ Local Setup
Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kukaas/recipe-sharing-api.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into the cloned repository directory and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Go to `index.js` file and change **mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://admin:12345@api-sharing.wwdxcbn.mongodb.net/api-sharing?retryWrites=true&w=majority')** with your actual MONGODB connection.

4. **Start the Server**: Now, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node . 
```

The server will start, and you should see a message like <span style="color:green"><strong>Server running on http://localhost:3000...</strong></span> in your terminal.

5. **Test the Application**: You can now test the application by sending requests to <span style="color:green"><strong>Listening on http://localhost:3000/recipe</strong></span>. You can use a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests.
